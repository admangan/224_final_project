They know that when they enjoy with life, they lose somethings. But, young people can not know they will be loser, when they begin to enjoy with life.\n\tTo me, all people enjoy life when they are young. Because, young people neither know, nor consider value of life. For instance, in Turkey all young people go to the parties, at all. They spend their time on fun. If you go to a club in Turkey, you can see young people, but you cannot see older people. \n\tIn addition to this example, older people prefer to rest, rather than to go to enjoy. For instance, in here, old people become retired when they spend a lot of years to work. After that, they are usually found, or seen at their houses. Because they find their houses more comfortable than out of home. But young people use different method, when they are tired. For instance, in my university, there are parties at the end of all semesters. All students at the university are found at these parties. On the other example, young people don't want to be their houses, when they  are tired or angry to anything. I usually drive my car, when I am not happy. I like to do speed with my car. If I become my house during bad time, I become worse.\n\tFinally, young people spend more time to enjoy than older people. Because, when people are young they don't know that they will be loser when they spend time on fun, rather than on studying, or on working.That is to say, people learn the value of life from youngster to oldster. When young people become old people, they start to spend less time on fun than before.\n"

        "essays": "Being successful is about knowing what you are doing and how you are doing it. But it's also about taking chances and working hard to seek your ambitions and aspirations. And to do so, people should try new things and take new chances. But at the same time, they should be very careful with their actions and decisions, so that they won't regret if anything had happened wrong.\n\nFirst, In order to be successful, people should know exactly what they want and what they are looking for. For example, If a man wants to be successful in his job he needs to be working for something he really likes and he's really good at. And not doing something just because that was the only opprotunity he got. He should try and find what he is good at and find what he really wants. Having a successful life is about having a happy, fulfilled and satisfying life.\n\nSecond, People who want to be successful should go and find their own chances instead of just waiting for the chances to come to them. And if they passed through something hard along the way they should try their best to make it through without crumbling. They have to make the best out of everything.\n\nThird, successful people have to obtain the knowledge and the wisdom on how to keep their success rising instead of falling. Being successful once doesn't mean that someday you won't be a failure. A person has to be confident in his work so that he wouldn't regret his actions later.\n\nTo become a seccessful person and to obtain that postition. You have to know what you are looking for, try to reach out for your goals, and being confident in what you are doing. And at the end you will have a happy life.\n"

Howwever, in my opinion use of cars would be decrease in twenty years, becauase of a probable shortage of petrol, introduce of tough provision for global warming and the possibility of invention of anothee types of behicles. The  following essay explain to support my perspective in more detail. \n\nTo begin with, the amount of gas and exhaustion emitted by cars are crutial when it comes to addressing reduction of global warming and air pollution. Many governments nowadays promote poeples use of pubic transportation for commuting. In near future, it is likely that several nations make policies and procedures for that promotion, the aim of which much be to decease people&s use of cars.\n\nFuthermore, petrol price has been becoming higher and higher because of the shortage in the near future. Therefore, It seems that people will have to begin thinking about another types of behicles, which do not use petrol. At the moment, several car canpanies have  tried to create electric cars, but still it is too pricy to target ordinaly people. Remarkably, some of the companies already started improving the techniques to creat other types of reasonable behicles.\n\nIn conclusion, I belive the techniques and environmental concerns about global wraming will be promoted by 2026. Use of cars  might shift to newly produced behicles. Hence, this is predictable that the ues of cars would decrease than we use at present. \n"

However, sometimes if a person chooses to take many academic subjects, it gets interesting. Lets say for example, a person takes biology, history and phsycology. All this knowledge is a great advantage! It leads the person to be more knowledgable, more aware of lots of things and also gives a sense of fun. Your mind expands and gets different and interesting information each day from different topics.\n\n\tKnowledge is a bunch of facts that you accquire from experiences and everyday routines. knowledge on one thing makes life boring especially for a person who is always curious and wants to learn new things. knowledge is unlimited, you have access to it anytime and anywhere. I could choose to know everything about one certain topic but that limits my knowledge to that one topic. But how about knowing information about different topics? this makes you even more social with different type of people. A doctor who knows history gets people astonished. They begin to understand the fact that he is good at what he does but also has interest for many other things. \n\n\tIn high school, i've always chosen different electives like music, french and also computer lessons. I wanted to know more about each or even be good at them like in my major subject. It made me feel wise and able to talk to people about alot of subjects. I could argue and talk in different areas with different types of people, it gives a good impression and also makes my life interesting to learn new stuff and facts everyday. That explains why actors now are persuing careers in singing or being leaders of charity acts or organizations. They want to try more. \n\n\tIt's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. To learn different facts everyday gives color to the mind. Life is short as they say, so make use of it. \n"

I can not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons.\n     To begin with, the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has less time that we can spend free.  Most of these trips have very tight schedule.  We have to see the famous place more quickly and we can not choose the gift for our friends or parents slowly.  In my opinion, traveling should be more flexible and reluxing.\n     In addition,  the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has little chance to happening.  I think that happning is very important factor to enjoy trip.  When I went to Italy with my friend,  I meet one  Italian chef in a bus by chance.

        "essays": "If most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are? I would say probably yes, because that is the aim of advertisement itself. \nAll professions have a reason for being. Lawyers try to avoid or solve conflicts between two or more parties. Doctors try to cure sick people and prevent their pacients of getting ill. Teachers educate and teach their studentes. So what do professionals in the advertisement area do? They try to raise the sell of their clients products. \nIn order to convince a group of the population to buy a certain product, you have to give them reasons to do so. On the first place the publicists define a certain target group for the product they want to sell: male or female, teenager or grown ups, professional women or housewifes, and so on. Once they have a certain group of possible buyers, they have to enhance the benefits of the item for that party of the population. Telling someone the negative consecuences of something is not a good marketing. So they just tell the possible consumers about the great advantages of using this product, making only reference to the pro's and leaving out the con's. An advertisement will probably mention how much better or efficient than other companies' products this item solves a certain issue or conflict. Making a difference, that is one of the keystones. Also, an advertisment generally tries to enhance all the improvement the use of this product will do in one's life, not only on the purpose of itself but also in a broader way. Using a certain milk product will suddenly not only be better because of the calcium in the milk, it will also make you look healthier and younger, have a better skin, and - why not - find a boyfriend or enjoy more the time with your children. \nThese are the ways advertisment works and reaches the people: directed to the right group of consumers, mentioning only the benefits and enhancing those as good as possible, and then putting those consecuences into a larger picture. \nThat's why advertisements make a product seem much better than it really is, because that's what it's supposed to do. \n"

I have taken part in it just once. But in fact, I could not find any young people there. I reckon the reason why young people do not join that festival is that young people prefer to spend a time with their friend than family or their communities.

Actually, most of my friends live apart from their family.  It means that it is no longer possible to help thier communities. In fact they can help the communities where they live now. But they might feel like to do it because it not their home town. So may feel that they are stranger there more or less.\n\tAs far as I know, it is clear that young people do not help their communities much.

Coming to this particular topic of weather its better to have a broad academic knowledge on many subjects rather han specialization on one, i personally feel that keeping in mind the present global scenario and  growing competition its better to have a broad knowledge in many ascpects rather than to limit yourself to one particular field. \nWhy i think so is that,  it gives you the cutting edge over the others to survive in this otherwise predatory competition. By having broader knowledge you are not limited to one field only. Lets understand this by an example, suppose iam a laboratory technician and in addition to that i have a basic knowledge to handle  the accounts and also to manage a office, this not only addes to my profile but also give me an extra confidence to work in different work condition if iam imposed to them.(Here i have an standout advantage over a only laboratory technician.)\nNot only this it can be a source of some extra income which is very neccessary keeping in point of view the rising prices of commodities around the world.This can be understood by again looking into the example explained above, suppose i get from the laboratory early during the working days i might take some tutions of accounts as iam well verse with it also, this could add extra income to my pocket, doesn't it feels great. I am sure it feels so.\nAnd lastly but most importantly it gives you a sense of secured future in a way that  you are not limited to a particular field, if you are not satisfied with your current job environment you can easliy switch on to the other as you are not limited to a particular proficiency.\nYou can also change job when you feel ennui because of the same   stereotyped work.\nSo i would rather advocate to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.\nMy idea looking to present secnario is \"IT'S BETTER TO BE JACK OF ALL TRADES RATHER THAN MASTER OF NONE.\" \n"

Also substained by their young age and lower experience they can afford more risk and try situations that make their adrenalin level to the top. But all of this is only giuded by their desire to become experienced about life, this is not a real more enjoyng way of life.\nThe older part of the society does not spend a sad life. They have tried all that emotions in the past and now they can enjoy through others experiences. With many resposabilities to take care of, they can now get their enjoyment from what they have built, their families, their social relationship lasted many years, their jobs and so on. I do not think this is boring or less enjoying. \nMay be the difference that many underlines is in the impact of the two kinds of enjoyment. It is clear that what a boy do is spectacularly enjoying, i do not want to say it is not, but also the style of living fo an adult can offer a real enjoyment, just a different kind and perhaps more deeper in the soul. \nIn conclusion we can not do a garduatory about what gives us more enjoyment but, in a easier way of thinking, I want to say that every age has its own enjoyment, the problem is only how to catch it.\n\n"

In this society people should have their own proffesional job so they try to study one specipic subject. For example, there are many doctor in the world.

In the past, young people had lived in the poverty of the war or somthing like that. There were also much diseases and less person in good health than now. So, the new generation is more lucky and happy in a modern society. The new generation have new kind of activities which is explain by the fact that the society is being more rich. I agree that young people don't use their free-time in helping others. A teenager is more selfish than before because he is only interested in his hapiness such as playing sport or going shopping. I guess that he has not the desire to help people and be generous. I believe that I could be better if each person would give his money in associations for cancer or others diseases.\n\nHowever, some young people are more responsible than others.

Mistakenly since the beginning of the century, it has been believed that the reasons for success of some people who had started large companies were that they had introduced new concepts doing something different, and had taken risks. On the other hand, I believe that the reason for success are hard work, motivation and imagination. \n\nFirst I think that hard work usually fosters success. For example athlets are clear examples. The more and the harder they train, the better results they get. It is clear that athlets that get first positions in swimming races are not just risk people. Furthermore in academics or labor enviroument, the continuous effort is a valued factor. For instance Novel prizes are awared for work along several years and not just for one isolated paper or idea. \n\nIn the second place, imagination (and not just trying something new) is crucial for success (which is reaching a goal). Some people who we consider successful such as Thomas Edison, or Albet Einstain, were people with a huge imagination, and therefore they were able to introduce innovations or new theories. \n\nFinally, motivation is the main factor for success. Even if a person has the skill, the discipline and imagination, if s/he is not motivated nothing will show up. Motivation is the willingness or the reaons for  reaching a goal. For example several history acadamics explain that successfull people as athlets, business men, or scientist usually are inspired in a fact as solving a problem, illness, or to honor their parents, etc. \n\nConsequently agreeing that success in only related to people who are just risky or just try new things, will only capture a narrow view of sources success. Success depend on deeper and wider things that the two thing named in the prompt.\n\n\n\n"

        "essays": "I agree with the following statement depending on my own experience. there are 3 reasons supporting my point of view, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n    First, the defination of learning something is to acknowledge why things goes like that which is, in other words, to know fundations and the priciples of it. To learn facts such as \"the sun rises every morning and sets every evening\" is not actually \"knowing\" something, to understand why the sun act like this which could be explain as \"the earth is going around the sun\" is the real knowledge one can get. That's why either traditional school or experimental school both tend to explain clearly to students what's going on under the consequence.\n    Sencond, the biggest difference between human beings and animals is human can understand some mind or idea which, unlike simply facts, are not visible and make a conclusion.Some expriment states that, some kind of monkey can learn facts and make simply conclusion of what's going to happen next. But they cannot understand ideas above the consequence. That's the advantages that human beings live and develop. So it is of vital importance to let student learn to understand ideas more than just know facts.\n   Third, the yield of our society comes from creation and the followed construction. Creation is a complex thing which base on the accumulation of ideas. When one have many ideas which like bricks, he can easily put some of them together to make another thing like a building. And idea is also important to construction. While build some constructions, to know how can it be stable on ground is an idea of calculation. \n   So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n"

Some people believe that having a variety of knowledge about a range of academic subject is better than to master only one acadmic subject. However, without any doubt,  it is better for person to specialize only one subject in his academic life,  for his rest of life wheter he plans an  academic  career or not.\n\nFirst of all, if a man proceed to focus on only one subject  in his academic life,  he may become a proffessional or master about that topic. As a result , he may be a remarkable person who is recognized by  a range of people. Moreover, people begin to show theirs respect his  thoughts, academic works  or papers rather than others who are not special on the related topic.\n\nAs an another point of view, a  person who works only one subject may likely to help to develop a device for humankind. As an illustration, new technological advancements are emerging in everyday life such as those companies that produce computer chipset. They develop and design smaller and smaller computer chips while their effiency inceares. These companies produce technology but how ? the reason behind it is they hire the person who has a mastership on related research areas such as computers or electronic science.\n\nIn the conclusion , it is better for person to focus on only one subject in his academic career.

But I believe that this statement is not true.\n\tYoung people can enjoy life, most of them do. But the problem nowadays is that all the young kids and young adults have a desire to grow faster and mature earlier in order to be allowed to do more things. As well, many of them take several things for granted, such as children's games, situations and experiences that you only experience in your childhood. They believe that these situations such as climbing the tree or sleeping in a childrens' house will always be there for them to take. So they desire to grow up earlier in order to do the things they watch in tv, such as having a girlfriend/boyfriend or going to college. This fake believe robs them from their true fun, which at their age should be table games, or play station. For example, my younger cousin who is 9 wants to grow up as soon as possible. Therefore, he has bought (with his savings) things that a grown up should have like a cellphone. This obsesion to mature has shifted him away of the true enjoyable situations a child should experience. \n\tAs maturity comes in a time for everyone, adults know that their time on earth is limited. Thanks to their previous eagerness to grow up, they did not have the chance to experience all the situations life had to offer. Hence, this time, they will make time (if they need to) in order to enjoy themselves and live life to the fullest. Although as an adult, one has more responsabilities and concerns, everyone tries to make the time to relax and enjoy life. This desire for living life to the fullest together with the new oportunities they now have is what allows an adult to finally achieve the joy they've always been looking for. As joy is something everyone always desires, they will try to repeat their fun everytime they can. \n\tOverall, the statement that claims that young people have more fun than older people is a fallacy due several facts. Firstly, younger people try to run past their childhood in order to reach adulthood and have more freedom. But at this time, they are losing every oportunity to enjoy thier lives. Secondly, adults now that their time in the world is limited, hence they want to live to the fullest as they can. The truth is, adults due to their knowledge of life and time, are the ones that enjoy more life. \n\n"

        "essays": "The question about broad oder specialized education is rather difficult to solve. In my opinion there is no clear answer or solution to this problem.\nI think that a broad knowledge of many subjects is essential to succeed in work. For example in economics, is is very important to have certain knowledge of law, mathematics or information systems to only mention a few connected fields of study. Without background knowledge in these fields you will not be able to get a good degree in your study. Also it is important to have knowledge of culture and society, especially when you want to work and live in other countries. Here it is extremely neccessary that you learn something about the culture of the foreign country, so that you can live there as a part of the community. Also everybody should have a basic knowledge about the history of his country or geographical circumstances of the region he lives in. This knowledge can be seen of a basis that every person succeeding university should achieve.\nBut beneath this broad knowledge it also is quite useful to have a highly specialised knowledge in one certain field. In this specialized subject, you then can enjoy being a expert. This can not only be good for your personal career. If nobody wanted a highly specialized training, there would be no progress in science. Here we have good examples in natural sciences, for example physics. Every student of physics needs a basic education that also includes mathematics and chemistry. But to research in problems, that matter at present time, you need to highly specialize, because there is so much information, that a single human being would never be able to gain it all.\nTherefore I would say that you both need a broad knowledge of many subjects that are connected, but also must specialize in one field of study. A reasonable combination of this two aspects of training can give you an education, that will open you all doors for a future career.\n"

They are well matured and knows about the outer world much better than the old aged people in this generation. They really enjoy the things much better than a old age person do, because they are well aware of all the consequences about what they are doing.  For example , think of a student who tries to dirve a car in avery small age but his father is worried about him but he knews the consequences of it and drives a car which he enjoys a lot while driving. But  if Iam a previous generation tenneager i would  really think of it because the envoirnment then was not as today where we cant find a place to enjoy a lot. The main reason behind that is there no development  at that time in many areas. \n\nAnd taking in view of old aged people they dont seems to enjoy more as  the teenagers or young people do because, they are bound to there family and responsibitlies, which make them to look after all the family matters and they hardly have a time to enjoy the beautifull world . The old age people dont notenjoy a lot but they help their children do that .The young people doesnot have any soght of pressure on them such as family matters, bussiness and so on.
