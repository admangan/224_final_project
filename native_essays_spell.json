Thing about! Wont you think so? Now would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! To you ever time to chat with your friends or business partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, space act. Must think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. Now did you learn about other country/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. Of your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isn right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidden in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Father than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of trouble. Thank you for listening."

Using computers can help us find coordinate, locations, and able yourself to millions of information. Also computers will benefit us by helping with jobs as in planning a house plan and tying a @NUM1 page report for one of our jobs in less than writing it. Now lets go into the wonder world of technology. Using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line. Any people have space, facebooks, aim, these all benefit us by having conversations with one another. Any people believe computers are bad but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them? I am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how I make friends. Computers help us with finding our locations, coordinate and millions of information online. Of we didn't go on the internet a lot we wouldn't know how to go onto webster that @MONTH1 help us with locations and coordinate like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be in @LOCATION3. When your supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2. Million of information is found on the internet. You can as almost every question and a computer will have it. Would you rather easily draw up a house plan on the computers or take @NUM1 hours doing one by hand with ugly eager marks all over it, you are garrenteed that to find a job with a drawing like that. Also when applying for a job many workers must write very long papers like a @NUM3 word essay on why this job fits you the most, and many people I know don't like writing @NUM3 words non-stop for hours when it could take them I had an a computer. That is why computers we needed a lot now days. I hope this essay has impacted your lesion on computers because they are great machines to work with. The other day I showed my mon how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention sense slice bread! Now go out and buy a computer to help you chat online with friends, find locations and millions of information on one click of the button and help your self with getting a job with neat, prepared, printed work that your boss will love."

Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Others have different ideas. A great amount in the world today are using computers, some for work and some for the fun of it. Computers is one of man greatest accomplishments. Computers are helpful in so many ways, @CAPS4, news, and live streams. On't get me wrong way to much people spend time on the computer and they should be out interesting with others but who are we to tell them what to do. When I grow up I want to be a author or a journalist and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on time on the computer, one @MONTH1 spend more time then the other but you know exactly what @CAPS5 getting at. To what if some expert think people are spending to much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying natures and interesting with family and friends. For all the expert knows that its how must people make a living and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time and to be honest it's non of my concern and it shouldn't be the so called experts concern. People interact a thousand times a day on the computers. Computers keep lots of kiss of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers helps the @ORGANIZATION1 locate most wanted criminals. Is you can see computers are more useful to society then you think, computers benefit society."

        "essays": "Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benefit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable webster for research or to help find good books. Also online cataloguers or advertisements help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail \"@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because am out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said \"@CAPS3 would be impossible to get mail to our courtiers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is.\" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the modern communication abilities that computer proved us. Because information can be communicated so quick. so can research. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of research, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not possible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Would you imagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporter couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most business, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a webster and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalogue because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the customer's confidence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make webster to promote them serves and explain their star to potential customers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her restaurant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 her not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be bless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinces would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people research subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there."

        "essays": "Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very convent. Computers are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. By family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. His helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computers. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. His way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. In the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. His way more and more families can do activities together. Is one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. In other reason why the computers are good for society is education. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find the out, but will all the tools on the computers may people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to college. Of you are't up to going to school/college because your sick. You wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classroom can't afford one computer. The children want computers so hard. Of they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could lean about different countries far away. Is a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convince. Now a say the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to conference will other people so that there would be communication between work partners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. His is only one of the many reasons computers are very convient, subsequently computers are convient because you could book flights, vacation, rental, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation."

        "essays": "Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, @CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. The will never know unless they meet us somewhere. It this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat webster. Such as space and facebook. In these webster, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscape, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. @CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, @CAPS1 someone takes an embarrassing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the adduct who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. Now would you feel @CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Wouldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life."

Using computers reaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. Of you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the field? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. And-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there.\" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. To one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. He couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. His happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. It work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper.

His device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyone lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocer shopping and the store is too far. That do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Her are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Any products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kiss? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Met's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone doesn't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer.

With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? To entertainment like listing to music, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled least our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kiss love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple click; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, \"@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future."

Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even saber building. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 tens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kiss that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form tying to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kiss going to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and passed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. His happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that tens and even parents go into chat rooms online. His is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone gullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occurs in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. To you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kiss brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?"

They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. And-eye coordination is a useful ability that is used to expel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kiss felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, \"@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands.\" @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. Of someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of increasing it. Additional, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. Of someone wanted to research @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make people people and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerable people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happened in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. To one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can access family members you scarcely visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Obviously, computers are a useful aid in today era. their advancement push the world forward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handed coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technological advancement. The world would be secured and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or library put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of place you want people to live in?"

        "essays": "Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives. I believe this because who spend to much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. By first reason is I believe that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exercise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also believe that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. He wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privileges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. Of you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boost your social skill and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addicted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer. There are plenty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including sports, taking care of family, and any of your hobby. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I believe that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the the computer can't do everything."

Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much more better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 be, you get board, and hungry, and I know there some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat. There are many ways you can exercise. You can take walks, you can go join, you could play a sport, I mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer. I know some people that could be working all day and still come home to there computer. West is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer, you could just relax watch a movie, eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself, you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but that not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your donna have when you leave, and come back home too something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. To enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if your really into computers, try to balance your time out."

Each day new discovery are made from the people that use computers in our society, however many people say that computers are harmful to are community. Today I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are. To begin with discovery in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day new discovery are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for diseases would have never been discovered and more people. Would have died. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household necessity, and many more objects. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. To you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social network like twitter, space, facebook, and couture you will always have something to do. During this economic reception it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast. Any people also speed up their word by using the computer. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me."

Well I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exercise, interact face to face with people or use their minds to the best of their @NUM1. The more and more we advance in society we get lascar and forget to about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them. Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest @PERCENT1 of kiss in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exercise once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this, @PERCENT1 of kiss. Hats more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the and compared it in @CAPS3 children who don't the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exercise only once a week. That's for less what these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 @PERCENT2 of children are overnight and @PERCENT3 of them develop heart of blood problems as adults. I by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike, or go for a joy. It doesn't sound hard does it? Of we make a to spend this than on computers I think we can reduce this obesity amount and I believe @CAPS2 ran as on overall country. In the computer we have popular webster like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. More webster allow you interact with people over the island. His could be in more ways than one. These computer webster are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them. With this personal into, could and with these webster the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these webster cause people to their social skill. People spend hours on these webster talking to people and forget how to talk face to face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. His creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicide and because of computers and I believe with less of them people would spend more time with their family and or nation would be closer and safer. Computers dont allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make it easy and I myself, think it makes me lascar because it allow me to read a book there or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution. There's years and I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing them and not realize it at all. Without them, would make a difference. Lids are living through computers and we can change them."

Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foreign places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! \"In average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to the, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household shores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. Of more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want that. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. His can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. He @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. \"The internet gives us access to the world,\" says @PERSON1, \"we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment.\" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite you with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch with many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most tens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Bites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! He found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! His also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. Is you can see. computers don't just \"your brain,\" they improve hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know!"

Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new ratification pips up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. By entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so useful for several reasons, like making plans and parties.

Or, for an even simpler way of sending invitations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2.

I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant essaying call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me \"@CAPS3's up?\" or \"@CAPS4 was your day?\" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. Is you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. To @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?"

Examples like finding things out about history. People that changed the world and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn. For example, their are lots of webster that offer online tutoring or good ways to help you pass school. Other positive way is online dating sites. You can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most that I think that the best in my opinion is going to school online. Once your done with college and you are a use, for an example you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse then being a @ORGANIZATION2. I think computers has a positive effect on people."

A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kiss don't don't stay on the computer very long anyway. Homework, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have webster that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. Of you go to the school web page then there a link that brings you in a path games. There even a to a science webster. His helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a students interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 greater. His is where a computer can have aim, facebook, and even space help a kid impact with friends. Of a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unsettled. A computer also new friends from other towns. Been need to and make new friend will helps as in life. Of a been helps with a then they can ask a for help. Very student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils. you can stay home, have money and type the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing can be a haste and mess, so it saves time and the mess. Of @CAPS1 are words you dont understand then you can look them out. Computers are and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as us. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technology we have @DATE1."

Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. Obviously, computers are beneficial. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, as I said earlier. I know people say that where you are on be computer, you spend less time exercising, but the computers help you with you throwing skill. And by coordination also applies for if you want to be a surgeon/doctor. You need to have steady hands. That we ready to do whatever is needed. See, they do have a positive effect. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet. May you want to be an engineer when you grow up, you might want to learn anything and everything you can to be successful later on in that carer. That about a doctor, you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree. A computer helps you learn about those things. It can also teach you about tons of other things. Again, how could they not be positive. I think computers have a positive effect on people. Another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away. Nail can so my where with enough, yes, but @CAPS3-mail is free and gets there in less than a minutes where mail can lake weeks to go far. For example, what if you came from another country. You wouldn't want to lose touch with people you grew-up with. With a computer, you could use type to see now new the person. Talking on the phone or failing doesn't even compare to that. You could never lose touch! Computers help people do all kinds of things. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. There are no bad reason that could top any of these. They make sense. To, what do you think? To you think they are good for us, or do we need less computers?"

        "essays": "Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kiss do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolation yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kiss are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kiss who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. Is a consequence, kiss start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! By second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kiss is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. The does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. His shows that even \"A\" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! His shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skill. By last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skill of being on outdoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mon or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranks and rude to your family just because you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. To you really want to act that way to your family? To, in humming up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?"

Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benefit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intact with friends or family that live faraway, and stay organized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homage, you automatic see the news needs of things happening around the world. Other times people go online deliberately to learn. Of someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equator many choice will pop up you climate, seasonal weather, hotel option, and other parts. But that not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. His is because some students like calm quickness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay touch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my befriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badly ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a video chat! I felt like I was right their with her! His was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay touch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easy, and your personal wants can chat and email are a easy thing to send world wide. To many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clatter, and I have so many school hinders for papers to be lost in. His is why I take great advantage of tying my paper every chance I get. By computer keeps me organized because I could never loose my work. Mile save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. When all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster type than I am writer so my work is a lot needed on the computer. Is you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is good for our society you can learn, stay touch with friends and family, and stay organized. Any people, could agree with me.

The bad part is that these \"exports\" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigators to find directions to a certain location if you can find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opinion is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isn doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost relative you haven spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmaster if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Am not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite option on the computer is that you can use it to navigable a certain location you want to go to. Gets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. Of this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one."

Those people who supports advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation clear I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better exercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interesting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in the computer more their doing things better in life. First, because it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the neighborhood of just going for a like with people you know. Even better going to the grm its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting front of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is what going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Rods creation of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Take imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch moves or any sports channels. To with them for some ice cream. Wont let them feel left out or unmoved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parts like six flag or lake compound of place like roads or chuckle cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. His is why I think sitting front of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting front of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!"

Study show that @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likely to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likely to have good people skill.

Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excessive could be very bad you and others.

I wonder what it will be like?"
